[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kekru/engelsystemgoesmobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kekru/engelsystemgoesmobile)  
This is a mobile fork for the [welcomehelpde / engelsystem](https://github.com/welcomehelpde/engelsystem).

# Installation

With ionic it is very easy to install the system on devices or on your computer:

To install ionic please follow the guides from [ionicframework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/)

Ionic has dependencies to npm, cordova, gulp and bower!

After installation clone this repository and navigate into the projectfolder. In this folder type the following cmd Command: `ionic state restore`.
 
After this you can run `ionic serve` to view results in browser.

If you are behind a corporate proxy ... good look ...

# Tests

To do a bit like TDD I build tests. You can rum them with `karma start`. In a future version it would be integrated into jenkins!  

Travis CI is ready :) Look here for how to add it to the welcomehelp/engelsystemgoesmobile
